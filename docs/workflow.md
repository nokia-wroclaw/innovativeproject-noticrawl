# Workflow
## Getting started
Each task has an *Issue* associated with it. *Issues* are created and assigned to team members by a leader. When you start resoving an *Issue*, you **have to change** a *Label* from *To Do* to *Doing*

## Before writing a code
Before starting writing a code, **create a new branch**. You can use a command `git checkout -b <branch name>`. Name a branch using this convention: *{Issue number}-{Issue title}* and use only lowercase and hyphens. So for example for an *Issue* named `Sign-in page setup #1` branch shuld be named `1-sign-in-page-setup`.  
 
## After writing some code
After writing some code and pushing **at least one commit** to repository, you should create a *Pull request*, so others can see changes you make and review them.

## After finishing task
After finishing task change *Issue* and *Pull request* label from *Doing* to *To Reviev* and notify others, so they can review your code.

## Merging
After successful review you can merge your pull request.
