## Running backend server locally
#### Using docker-compose (recommended)
`docker-compose up`
#### Directly on your computer (if for whatever reason Docker is not working properly)
`poetry run task dev-server` from /backend directory

### After running a server it will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000
